This is a basic VLAN routing lab. Using SVIs on a Layer 3 Cisco switch, interVLAN routing was achieved. As with all of my labs, I try to avoid configuring the topology in the topology.yml file, with the intention of configuring the lab entirely in CLI. IPv4 pooling for this was configured in topology.yml to ensure hosts had a consistent host IP as to avoid unecessary linux IP configuration to work with the VLAN routing.
