This is an offshoot of my Multiarea_OSPF lab. I wanted to add redundancy to all "offices" and "datacenter/srv" while maintaining proper intended routes for packets. "ru" (redundancy routers) are placed in each area to ensure if the main router per subnet's interface into the subnet fails, it will pick up the role of routing packets to the corresponding switch or srv. In addition, redundancy was added to the core series of routers in area 0, to ensure routes to each subnet remain available even if an interface connected to the backbone drops. See Multiarea_OSPF for the initial topology and changes made compared to OSPF_M_Redundancy topology. 

The lab was tested by "shutdown" on numerous interfaces. Results showed proper redundancy in the case of singular interface failure on the core routers (within reason).
